# A system of linear equations is said to be ill-conditioned if its condition number is high. The condition number (Îº(A)) of a matrix A is a measure of how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input argument. For linear systems, it quantifies the sensitivity of the solution vector x to changes or errors in the input data (coefficients and constants).
